My First Stab at GoDot

The plan is for this to become a turn based sci-fi RPG. 

The genre being somewhere between a 3 and 4 on Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness

Things to do (everything at this early stage):
  Menus
  Ship-based combat (stealth/ambush, think submarine style combat)
  Character/Individual combat (tactical RPG)
  Hyperspace (maze mini-game)
  Points of interest interactions (trading, quests)
  Plot/Storylines
  Galaxy map (randomly generated graph of node connections)
